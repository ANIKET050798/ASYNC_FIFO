aniket async FIFO

Designed Asynchronous FIFO in Verilog & verified it for write/read frequency of 50 MHz and 20 MHz.
Synchronization of FIFO pointers is accomplished using Gray Code to avoid multi-bit signal transitions.
Implemented 2 Flip-Flop Synchronizer to increase meta-stability resolution time in CDC.
